      Spend four hours at the sea for a tranquil session snorkelling. If the
      weather is great, you will see the fish. Finswimmers do not normally use
      snorkels with a sump valve, as they learn to blast clear the tube on most
      if not all exhalations, which keeps the water content in the tube to a
      minimum as the tube can be shaped for lower work of breathing, and
      elimination of water traps, allowing greater speed and lowering the stress
      of eventual swallowing of small quantities of water, which would impede
      their competition performance.

## Test heading

Snorkeling is a popular recreational activity, particularly at tropical resort locations. The primary appeal is the opportunity to observe underwater life in a natural setting without the complicated equipment and training required for scuba diving. It appeals to all ages because of how little effort there is, and without the exhaled bubbles of scuba-diving equipment. It is the basis of the two surface disciplines of the underwater sport of **finswimming**.
